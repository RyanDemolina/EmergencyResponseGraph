<H1> COP3530 - Project 3 </h1>

<h2> Emergency Response Path </h2>

Our projectâ€™s goal is to determine the shortest path to and from a point to a nearby hospital in order to minimize response time to an emergency. Since time is crucial when responding to an emergency, it is important for emergency vehicles to take the shortest route to get to and from their desired location.

## Getting Started with the Project

1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/RyanDemolina/EmergencyResponseGraph.git
   ```
OR

2. Open in CLion
   * Open CLion
   * Select File -> New -> Project From Version Control -> Enter the repository url in the given space

## Visualizing Path 

After running your code and a path is found, the coordinates for the route will be written to the corresponding files

* "Dijkstra.csv"
* "BellmanFord.csv"

The Google Colab with the code to run the visualization can be found here: 
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17MTQxoJUx5d9Jj3T2soyZJ88WVRwLtgq?usp=sharing)

Within the colab, on the left hand side menu, select Files -> Upload Files -> Select Both "Dijkstra.csv" and "BellmanFord.csv"

To run the full notebook, at the top ribbon, select Runtime -> Run All

### Enjoy Your Interactive Visualization of the Shortest Path!!!
